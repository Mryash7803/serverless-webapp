Serverless Guestbook on AWS
This is a full-stack, serverless web application that functions as a public guestbook. Users can view all entries and submit their own messages, which are dynamically added to the list without a page refresh.

The project is built entirely on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and demonstrates a modern, event-driven, and highly scalable serverless architecture. It was built as a hands-on project to showcase foundational skills in cloud computing.

The application follows a classic serverless pattern, ensuring low cost, automatic scaling, and minimal operational overhead.

Frontend (Client): A static single-page application (SPA) built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript is hosted in an AWS S3 bucket configured for static website hosting.

API Layer: API Gateway provides a public HTTP API endpoint that the frontend can communicate with. It is responsible for routing requests to the backend logic.

Backend Logic (Compute): An AWS Lambda function, written in Python, contains all the business logic for handling GET (fetch all entries) and POST (add a new entry) requests.

Database: Amazon DynamoDB, a fully managed NoSQL database, is used to store the guestbook entries.

Permissions: An AWS IAM Role is attached to the Lambda function, granting it the specific permissions needed to write logs to CloudWatch and to read/write data from the DynamoDB table.

Technologies Used
Backend
AWS Lambda: Serverless compute for running backend logic.

Amazon API Gateway: Creating and managing the public HTTP endpoint.

Amazon DynamoDB: NoSQL database for data persistence.

Amazon S3: Static website hosting for the frontend application.

AWS IAM: Securely managing permissions and access between services.

Amazon CloudWatch: Logging and monitoring for debugging
